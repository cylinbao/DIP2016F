This is the description about how to use my matlab script of the DIP HW3

hw3.m:
You can use matlab to execute this script directly. 
It will process the four images and store them with the naming rules.

imgeh.m:
This script contains a function used by hw3.m.
It will basically process the three steps described in my report.
First, it will do the histogram equalization.
Second, it will do guassian blurring.
Finally, it will sharpen the image with unsharp masking technique.

myhisteq.m:
This is my implementation on the matlab function histeq().
The detailed process algorithm is described in my report.
